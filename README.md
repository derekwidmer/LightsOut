# Lights Out Game
A React take on the popular "Lights Out" handheld game. Player must turn all of the lights out to win the game. Whatever tile the player clicks will toggle on/off along with its 4 adjacent tiles.

## What I Learned
Passing functions to child components as props, conditionally styling dumb components and some bonus cool css styling!

## To Play
*Must have npm installed*

First, clone the repo to your machine.

Navigate to the directory and run these lines:
```
npm install
npm start
```
